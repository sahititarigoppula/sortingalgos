# Sorting Algorithms

A Java Program for Sorting Algorithms

This programs expects space seperated list of values as input. Please end the list with any character variable ( i.e. \[a-z])

```shell
Enter numbers, with any character at the end
5 6 9 8 0 /
```
Select the Sorting Algorithm from the mentioned list ( Bubblesort / Insertionsort / Mergesort )

```shell
Enter Sorting Algorithms ( Bubblesort / Insertionsort / Mergesort )
Bubble sort
```

Based on the Sorting Algorithm provided as input, it sorts the provided list and gives the sorted list as an outcome.

```shell
Array entered: [5, 6, 9, 8, 0]
Algorithm: BUBBLESORT
Sorted Array in Ascending Order:
[0, 5, 6, 8, 9]

```
